# About Me

Hello! I'm mostly developing Minecraft shaders and little command-line games.

If you are looking for a shaderpack I made, do check out [Rethinking Voxels](https://github.com/gri573/rethinking-voxels).

If you don't have a graphical environment, you can try my [CLI Games](https://github.com/gri573/cli-games), or my [voxel sandbox game](https://github.com/gri573/voxel-cli), although the latter is not intended for actual gameplay (it features ray traced graphics though).
